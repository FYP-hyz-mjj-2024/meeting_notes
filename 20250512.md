# Discussion Summary

## 1. Further Increment on YOLO Dataset Collection
- Promoted the dataset with some fruits and objects in market.
- Some cell phone data of calling with phone in hand next by ears are also recorded.

## 2. Literature Review
Renamed the project name to `Real-time Pedestrian Cell Phone Usage Detection`.

Found two relative works, one use open-pose to directly consume the image of skeleton presentation, the latency is also kind of poor.
- They video-image classification based.
- They used temporal features.
- They regard pedestrian cell phone usage as a unified semantic.

Our Arguments:
- Video-image based classification is vulnerable to pixel-related irrelevant features.
- Temporal feature inclusion introduces real-time performance overhead while promoting little accuracy in detection.
- Pedestrian cell phone usage are divided into a prioritized two independent semantics
	- Usage: Pedestrian is engaging with an object.
	- Cell Phone: The object is a cell phone.

Our System:
- Our group select full angles and corresponding confidence scores from combination of key points upper-body, and translated them as 2-channel 3D features for better network inference on deep feature extraction.
- The performance comparison between their works and ours can hardly be done as the datasets we used are different and we fail to find their released system.

## 3. Ablation Study
Study 1: Remove convolution layers from the adopted model (Conv+FC), leaving only the fully-connected layers (FC).
- Other hyperparamters are identical.
- FC converges at a further epoch of 77, compared to Conv+FC's 34.
- FC's min validation loss is higher than Conv+FC's.

Study 2: t-SNE on flattened 2C3D features and  Hijacked 1848 interim outputs of Conv+FC and FC.
- Result: Linear separability: Flattened feature < FC < Conf+FC

Result: Convolution plays an important role in posture recognition.

## 4. Presentation
- Preparation of equipment for the graduation demonstration
	- Who we need to contact to rent equipment and what equipment can we rent.
	- What we need to prepare for the graduation demonstration.
- Submission of git repo
	- How to submit the large raw model file to school git? 
	- Sending message to the relevant professor.
