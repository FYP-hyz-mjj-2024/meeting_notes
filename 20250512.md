# Discussion Summary

## 1. Further Increment on YOLO Dataset Collection
- Promoted the dataset with some fruits and objects in market.
- Some cell phone data of calling with phone in hand next by ears are also recorded.

## 2. Report - Literatures review
- Renamed the project name to Real-time Pedestrian Cell Phone Usage Detection.
- Found two relative works, one use open-pose to directly consume the image of skeleton presentation, the latency is also kind of poor.
- Our group select full angles and corresponding confidence scores from combination of key points upper-body, and translated them as 2-channel 3D features for better network inference on deep feature extraction.
- The performance comparison between their works and ours can hardly be done as the datasets we used are different and we fail to find their released system.

## 3. Preparation of equipment for the graduation demonstration
- Who we need to contact to rent equipment and what equipment can we rent.
- What we need to prepare for the graduation demonstration.

## 4. The submission of git repo
- How to submit the large raw model file to school git? Sending message to the relevant professor.
