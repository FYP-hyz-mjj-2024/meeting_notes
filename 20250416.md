# Discussion Summary
## 1. Finishing Touches
Reviews GitHub commit history to summarize our efforts. The entire project is de-composed into a series of unique and discrete **works**. 
#### 1.1 Work ID
Work ID is the manual identification (or primary key) to identify a unique work. It's composed from 3 parts: Section, Assignee and Current Usage Status.
- Section: Which part of the project is this work applying.
- Assignee: `I` for **I**ndividual and `P` for **P**air.
- Status: `A` for **A**ctive and `D` for **D**eprecated.
#### 1.2 Work Timespan
Each work is assigned a timespan. A timespan of a work is a list of work cells, where each cell denotes half a month. The from-to date is written in the cell, and each cell therefore has a date range. The sum of the date range of all such cells in a work's timespan gives the total date range.
