Reviews GitHub commit history to summarize our efforts. The entire project is de-composed into a series of unique and discrete works. A work is the basic unit to quantify group mates' work.
#### 1.1.1 Work ID
Work ID is the manual identification (or primary key) to identify a unique work. It's composed from 3 parts: Section, Assignee and Current Usage Status.
- Section: Which part of the project is this work applying.
- Assignee: `I` for **I**ndividual and `P` for **P**air.
- Status: `A` for **A**ctive and `D` for **D**eprecated.
#### 1.1.2 Work Timespan
Each work is assigned a timespan. A timespan of a work is a list of work cells, where each cell denotes half a month. The from-to date is written in the cell, and each cell therefore has a date range. The sum of the date range of all such cells in a work's timespan gives the total date range.
#### 1.1.3 Subjective Importance Factor
Each work is assigned a subjective importance factor mutually agreed between group mates. The importance factor ranges from 0 to 8.
#### 1.1.4 Work Scores
For a work $i$, given:
- Subjective Importance Factor $w_i$
- Total Date Range $t_i$
- Work Cell Number $c_i$
The score of this work $i$ is calculated as:

$$
s_i = 0.2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{t_{i}\cdot c_{i}^{2}} + 0.8 \cdot w_{i}
$$
### 1.1.5 Personal Contribution
For each work, both members have a contribution portion ranging from 0 to 1 and sums to 1. For `I` works, one of the two portions is 1 and the other is 0. For `P` works, both are not 0. For a work $i$, and a person $p$, given:
- The person's portion $d_{p}$
- The score of work $s_{i}$
The contribution of person $p$ on work $i$ is:
$$
contrib_{i,p} = d_{p} \cdot s_{i}
$$
> [!Note]
> The scores are calculated using Google App Script and applied on Google Sheets.

## 1.2 README

Refine a detailed `README.md` configuration document for the three repositories.

### 1.3 Report
Start writing report according to the distribution.
