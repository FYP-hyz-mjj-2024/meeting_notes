# Discussion Summary

## 1. Coordinate Transformation
We visualized YOLO inference result for better debugging, rather than just making the hand frame red. Since hand images are cropped out and resized as an input to YOLO, it is required to perform a coordinate transformation before visualization.

### Algorithm
**Input**
- Relative mother frame `wm_rel, hm_rel`
- Absolute mother frame `wm_abs, hm_abs`
- Absolute mother frame `xm_abs, ym_abs`
- Relative inference result `x_rel, y_rel, w_rel, h_rel`
**Output:**
- Absolute inference result `x_abs, y_abs, w_abs, h_abs`
**Process:**
- Let `x_abs = (wm_abs / wm_rel) * x_rel + xm_abs`
- Let `y_abs = (hm_abs / hm_rel) * y_rel + ym_abs`
- Let `w_abs = (wm_abs / wm_rel) * w_rel`
- Let `h_abs = (hm_abs / hm_rel) * h_rel`
- Output: `x_abs, y_abs, w_abs, h_abs`

## 2. More `NULL` Data for YOLO
- Tried metal cans and other drink boxes.
- While using the postures of using them normally.
- DEFICIENCY: The awkward thing is that if the pedestrian is waring in white, the performance can go down real quickly.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
- Need a higher resolution camera.
- Add white background for positive data for YOLO. Add fruit images into dataset as NULL.
