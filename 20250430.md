# Discussion Summary
## 1. Added more non-phone data under complicate background
- Tried metal cans and other drink boxes.
- While using the postures of using them normally.
- The awkward thing is that if the pedestrian is waring in white, the performance can go down real quickly.

## 2. Draw out the objects the YOLO object-detector found
Wrote a function to convert relative position to absolute position, and mark the position of the "mobile phone" identified by YOLO.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
