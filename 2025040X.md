# Discussion Summary

## 1. Extension work
### 1.1 gaze estimation
- Try exploring the usage of `pygaze` and `ptgaze` API interfaces to assist in determining the facial orientation and gaze vectors of people in front of the camera!
- The tools can help to make inference on where the person is looking at:![[Pasted image 20250331221206.png]]
- The gaze vector is a 3d tuple of floats. Maybe we can use it with YOLO object detection to determine whether the person is playing cell phone.

### 1.2 problem of applying gaze estimation
1. Firstly, it seems like there are few different models supplied on the source git. That means we can not use a lighter and quicker model without training one by ourselves.
2. The tools have to locate the faces again, which we had already done in mmpose.

## 2. Bug Fixes
### 2.1 Focal Loss Alpha
Alpha is the balancing factor in focal loss. 

$$
    L_{FL}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i} \cdot y_{i}\cdot(1-\text{softmax}(\mathbf{x})_{i})^{\gamma}\cdot\log(\text{softmax}(\mathbf{x})_i)
$$

We fixed a bug where a single alpha in the original focal loss is used. It is suggested to use an alpha for the positive data and a corresponding 1-alpha for the negative data samples (according to the author of this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002v2). The paper suggested to use the inverse frequency as the alpha, but since our data is too abundant (over 10,000), we used the negative sample's portion as the alpha for the positive samples, which is around 0.377.

## Next Meeting's Agenda
1. Excessive Improvement: May try to learn the main knowledge of gaze estimation and schedule to apply the tech in our project to improve the performance. The result of this is not guaranteed, and it is considered an excessive improvement.
2. Add more user management features in the storage backend.
