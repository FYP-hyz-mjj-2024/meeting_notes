# Discussion Summary

## 1. Gaze Estimation: An Excessive Attempt

### 1.1 Open-Source Surfing
Try exploring the usage of `pygaze` and `ptgaze` API interfaces to assist in determining the facial orientation and gaze vectors of people in front of the camera! Repo: https://github.com/padmalcom/pygaze. The tools helps to infer the gaze direction of a person:

The gaze vector is a 3d tuple of floats. Maybe we can use it with posture recognition model to perform a more robust inference.

### 1.2 Performance Issue
1. Firstly, it seems like there are few different models supplied on the source git. That means we can not use a lighter and quicker model without training one by ourselves.
2. The tools have to locate the faces (with object detection) again, which we had already been done with RTMPose detection landmarks.

## 2. Frontend & Storage Backend
### 2.1 Unified Search
A unified search is provided. Now, for both "faces" and "users", the operator could perform searching in a generic search bar element. The backend provides the service of blurry search queries.

```typescript
// Generic search bar react component.
export const SearchBar = <TRequestItem, TResultItem,>(props: {
    children: (props: { resultItem: TResultItem, key: number }) => React.ReactNode,
    router: NextRouter,
    searchFunc: (
        submitData: any,
        callbacks: RequestCallbacks<TResultItem>
    ) => void,
    placeholder: string,
}) => {...}
```

The web page will also warn the superuser if he/she wants to revoke permissions for him/themselves.
## 2.2 Bug: Image Resolution
The image resolution from the inference backend is adjusted-down again since it didn't pass the stress test.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
1. We're planning to migrate the storage of JWT token to cookies from localStorage.
	1. Simplicity: It's automatically included in the request without explicit definition.
	2. Safety: Prevent CRSF attacks.
