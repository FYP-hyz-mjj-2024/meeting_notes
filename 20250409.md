# Discussion Summary

## 1. Gaze Estimation: An Excessive Attempt

### 1.1 Open-Source Surfing
Try exploring the usage of `pygaze` and `ptgaze` API interfaces to assist in determining the facial orientation and gaze vectors of people in front of the camera! Repo: https://github.com/padmalcom/pygaze. The tools helps to infer the gaze direction of a person:

The gaze vector is a 3d tuple of floats. Maybe we can use it with posture recognition model to perform a more robust inference.

### 1.2 Performance Issue
1. Firstly, it seems like there are few different models supplied on the source git. That means we can not use a lighter and quicker model without training one by ourselves.
2. The tools have to locate the faces (with object detection) again, which we had already been done with RTMPose detection landmarks.


## 2. Frontend & Storage Backend
### 2.1 Unified Search
A unified search is provided. Now, for both "faces" and "users", the operator could perform searching in a generic search bar element. The backend provides the service of blurry search queries.

```typescript
// Generic search bar react component.
export const SearchBar = <TRequestItem, TResultItem,>(props: {
    children: (props: { resultItem: TResultItem, key: number }) => React.ReactNode,
    router: NextRouter,
    searchFunc: (
        submitData: any,
        callbacks: RequestCallbacks<TResultItem>
    ) => void,
    placeholder: string,
}) => {...}
```

The web page will also warn the superuser if he/she wants to revoke permissions for him/themselves.
### 2.2 Bug: Image Resolution
The image resolution from the inference backend is adjusted-down again since it didn't pass the stress test.

## 3. Emergency Fix: Posture Recognition Model Malfunction
### 3.1 Revoke `MCLoss`
We discovered a deficiency brought by `MCLoss` (the combined loss using mainly `F.cross_entropy` instead of `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). The model trained using `MCLoss` can barely recognize negative samples. Therefore, we revoked this change.

### 3.2 (Deprecated) New Angle Calculation
We attempted to include negative angles as well, yet the application performance of that model is bad (barely recognizes negative samples), therefore we deprecated this change.

### 3.2 Reproducibility
To make the posture recognition model reproducible, we set two fixed seeds:
- A `cuda` seed to ensure initialization & training process to be more deterministic.
- A `numpy` seed to ensure train-validation split is deterministic.

## 4. Refinement: Lo-Res Data in YOLO dataset
We found that the YOLO model lacks abilities to recognize cell phones in larger distance (i.e., lower resolution images). To cope with this, we added 2071 pictures of data into the dataset. These data are designed to be:
- Having lower saturation, bringing more challenge to recognize in distance.
- Lower resolution, recorded from distanced point.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
(Frontend) We're planning to migrate the storage of JWT token to cookies from localStorage.
