# Discussion Summary

## 1.  Optimized  frame-clipping method

*Old method of frame around hands:*
Roughly clip subframe out of original frame. The center of subframe is added a direction bias proportional to the vector from elbow to wrist. After that, resize the subframe to $(640, 640, 3)$ directly using interpolation (done by opencv). This method caused in-accuracies because that this technique will expand and stretch the phone and make it displayed big, while the training set of YOLO has relatively small bounding boxes for phones.

*New method:*
Based on the old method, we optimized the size with the accordance to bounding box, and apply fill-in method instead of the resize method. This retained the size of the phone and made the model detect it more easily.

## 2. YOLO11
`yolo11s.pt` trained by official ultralytics git can easily detect cell phone with color of black, but is weak on detecting those with light color. We may need to find and augment our own dataset to find-tune an object detection model that's been dedicated to detect all kinds of phones.

## 3. Performance evaluation (especially on networks)
Focus on 3 networks:
- `MMPose`
- `MLP` (Our model)
- `YOLO11m`
Performance: 
- Small amount of people: `mmpose > yolo11m > MLP`
- Large amount of people:  Almost same

# Agenda for the next meeting
1. Performance Improvements: 
	1. Need to improve backend performance by remove useless operations in a loop.
	2. Improve the 1d/3d convoluted model structure for better performance.
	3. Find better protocols to push frame to front-end, give up the current solution of using react state refreshing that causes performance decay.
2. Decrease video sampling step.
	1. Increase data amount for formalizing the performance of the model.
	2. Cross-validation by using 7500 frames as train & 2500 frames as validation (4-Fold)
	3. Leave around 500 frames for testing.
3. Data Augmentation.
	1. Add some noise to the posture data to increase robustness.
