# Discussion Summary

## 1.  Undetectable Pedestrians
We introduced a new process of filtering out pedestrians that has low outcome of posture detection. These pedestrians will be ignored by the classifier to leverage performance on the detectable individuals. Currently, we have 2 undetectable pedestrians:

## 2. YOLO11
### 2.1 Model Training (In Progress)
Python package of `ultralytics` and `roboflow` is used. Roboflow's online workspace is used to manage training data to train a pre-trained YOLOv11 model to detect specifically for phones. (Training is done locally, we added a `step03_yolo_phone_detection` directory in the `yolo_dev` branch of `posture_mmpose`).
### 2.2 Interface Exposure
We expose the interface for the YOLOv11 model by cropping the sub-pictures of a person's hand and feed them into the model as inputs. 

## 3. Additional Dataset
We added additional dataset for the conditions when pedestrians are wearing thick clothes. This is done because that we discovered the issues that the posture detection model's performance is weak on pedestrians with thick clothes. We inspected that the MMPose inference result is quite different for people with thick clothes. Therefore, we recorded a full set of dataset with a thick clothes worn by the model.
