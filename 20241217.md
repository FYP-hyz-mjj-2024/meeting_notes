# Discussion Summary

## 1.  Optimized  frame-clipping method

Old method of frame around hands:
	Roughly clip subframe out of original frame. The center of subframe is added a direction bias proportional to the vector from elbow to wrist. After that, resize the subframe to $(640, 640, 3)$.
New method:
	Based on the old method, we optimized the size with the accordance to bounding box, and apply fill-in method instead of the resize method.

## 2. YOLO11
### 2.1 Apply General yolo11s.pt
yolo11s.pt trained by official ultralytics git can easily detect cell phone with color of black, but is weak on detecting those with light color.

## 3. Performance evaluation (especially on networks)
Focus on 3 nn :{MMpose pose detection, 1d/3d model, YOLO11s object detection}
	折线图
	发现： 效率/性能 mmpose > yolo11 > customed MLP

## Next Agenda
1. Data augmentation ? 
2. Structure improvement of our 1d/3d model?
