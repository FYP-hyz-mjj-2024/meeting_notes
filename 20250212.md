Today's discussion is mainly about work on YOLO11.

## 1. YOLO11 Dataset Gather
- Completed dataset gathering methods for YOLO 11 training.
	- RTMPose detect hand coordinate
	- Crop out hand frame
	- Export sub-frame images
- Export training images to Roboflow.
## 2. YOLO11 Automatic Training Process
- Automatic `best.pt` model and training log appending & overwriting the old verison.
- Automatic dataset version number increase.
Fully automatic training process. The YOLO model is automatically deployed to local and roboflow without extra actions needed.
