# Discussion Summary

## 1. Data increment on non-phone items
### 1.1 Collected 4081 photos of non-phone (NULL label)

This week, we tried to collect items that we might hold in our hands, like the cell phones we usually hold in when we walk down the streets. The detail is as follows.

### 1.2 Temporary result
We set the sampling step sizes of the video to be 5, which results in a doubled size of the dataset. The performance of the trained model is poor in application, as it could barely detect any cell phones in hand.

## 2. Frontend
The frontend now supports face management (face viewing), face uploading, face comparison and face deletion requests.

## Next Meeting's Agenda
1. Reduce the sampling step size to train a more generalized YOLO11 model.
2. Deploy the frontend in local and the storage backend in cloud server.
