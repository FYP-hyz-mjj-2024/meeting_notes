# Discussion Summary

## 1. Data increment on non-phone items
### 1.1 Collected 4081 photos of non-phone (NULL label)

This week, we tried to collect items that we might hold in our hands, like the cell phones we usually hold in when we walk down the streets.

The detail is as follows.

## 2. Recorded more YOLO data
 Considering on the situation that some people may incline his/her phone, we recorded 4 videos where the phone is inclined.

## 3. Modules
### 3.1 Software Module Formalization
By this phase, our project could be formalized to be consisting of 3 mutually independent part:
- **Inference Backend:** The platform where the inference state machine, the posture recognition model and the YOLO model are embedded. It produces the core information of the system: Who was using a cell phone and the face of that person.
- **Storage Backend:** A cloud-based service combining a simple server that manages API requests and a PostgreSQL database to store human faces. It serves basic CRUD of human faces, as well as face comparison feature.
- **Front-end:** A local webpage that displays the video output of the inference backend. It also serves as an interface to manipulate the storage backend with API calls.

### 3.2 New in Storage Backend
- Face management: Users can now upload and manage faces in the front-end.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
- Continue the revision of step03:
	- Add more NULL data to improve generalization ability.
- Refine and add relevant features in the storage backend.
	- Face updating
