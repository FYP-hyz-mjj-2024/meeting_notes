# Discussion Summary

## 1. Refactored the codes whole project
### 1.1 Disabled shuffling before splitting out test data in step02
- In step02, the codes wrote 6 month before had one mistake that each time the system train our customed 3d-CNN, the test data and train_and_valid data are different from the training process last time. ![[Pasted image 20250314175335.png]]
- The little correction may not improve the system significantly but can lead the project to be more perfect.

### 1.2 Remove abundant codes with method get_data_loader()
- Eliminated some interim values to improve the readability of codes.![[Pasted image 20250314175843.png]]

## 2. Recorded more YOLO data
 - Considering on the situation that some people may incline his/her phone, we recorded 4 videos where the phone is inclined.![[Pasted image 20250314180308.png]]
## 3. <[SUBTITLE]>
- Use `dlib` to achieve similar task as RTMPose:
	- Use `dlib`'s pre-trained face detector to detect faces and select the first face in the given image.
	- Use `dlib`'s pre-trained shape predictor to extract 68 face landmarks of the given image.
	- Use `dlib`'s pre-trained face recognition model to convert face landmarks to a 128-length feature vector.
	- *(We didn't train or fine-tune any of the `dlib`'s model. PyTorch is not required by `dlib`.)*
- To compare faces, we calculate the inversed Euclidean distance between the sample face vector and target face vectors.
- Face features are stored along with the face base64 string in PostgreSQL database to save query performance.

Storage of faces in the database:

### 3.1 Performance on Siblings
Comparing a sample face of Small S (Dee Hsu) among all the faces (including male & female). The most similar face to the sample is the one of Big S (Barbie Hsu), Small S's elder sister. However, since they are two different people after all, the top rank's score is not significantly high compared to others.

### 3.2 Performance on Exact Same Person
In this test, two images of different ages of the same person is used. Here, since they are the same person, the top rank's score is significantly higher than the others. Also, thanks to a preliminary caching policy, the query time at this stage is reduced.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
- Prepare a better model to precisely detect pedestrians watching cellphone.
- Schedule to record more data of non-phone items.
