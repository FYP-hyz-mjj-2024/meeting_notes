# Discussion Summary

## 1. Project Code Refactor
### 1.1 Disabled shuffling 
*Removed shuffling before splitting out test data in step02.*
In step02, the codes wrote 6 month before had one mistake that each time the system train our customed 3d-CNN, the `test` data and `train_and_valid` data differs from the training process last time.

The little correction may not improve the system significantly but can lead the project to be more perfect.

### 1.2 Remove Unnecessary Code
*Remove redundant code with method `get_data_loader()`.*
Eliminated some interim values to improve the readability of codes.

## 2. Recorded more YOLO data
 Considering on the situation that some people may incline his/her phone, we recorded 4 videos where the phone is inclined.

## 3. Modules
### 3.1 Software Module Formalization
By this phase, our project could be formalized to be consisting of 3 mutually independent part:
- **Inference Backend:** The platform where the inference state machine, the posture recognition model and the YOLO model are embedded. It produces the core information of the system: Who was using a cell phone and the face of that person.
- **Storage Backend:** A cloud-based service combining a simple server that manages API requests and a PostgreSQL database to store human faces. It serves basic CRUD of human faces, as well as face comparison feature.
- **Front-end:** A local webpage that displays the video output of the inference backend. It also serves as an interface to manipulate the storage backend with API calls.

### 3.2 New in Storage Backend
- Face management: Users can now upload and manage faces in the front-end.

# Next Meeting's Agenda
- Continue the revision of step03:
	- Add more NULL data to improve generalization ability.
- Refine and add relevant features in the storage backend.
	- Face updating
